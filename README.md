This code runs on an Arduino Mega and incorporates ten thermocouple breakout boards from Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1727) for the MAX31850K chip. It also features an LCD screen with an LCD backpack from Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/292), an Adafruit DS1307 RTC Breakout Board (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3296), an SD module from DFRobot.com, an Adafruit MCP9808 Breakout Board for reference temperature (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1782) and a push button.

The datalog interval can be set between 2 seconds up to an hour and datalogging can be switched on and off.
